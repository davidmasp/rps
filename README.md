# :robot: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a discord bot to play Rock Paper Scissors with.

## :hammer: Build

To build you need a python3 installation and make. Simply run:

```
make all
```

This command will install the required dependencies and launch the bot.

## :heavy_check_mark: Todo

- See where to host (in pythonanywhere is not ok for free accounts)
- Make the logging server specific (?)
